# ðŸš¨ URGENT DEPLOYMENT FIX - CORS Error

## Problem Identified:
```
?: (corsheaders.E014) Origin 'https://nasafinalll-k8rhh8xrg-roshith-roberts-projects.vercel.app/' in CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS should not have path
```

## Root Cause:
The FRONTEND_URL environment variable has a trailing slash (`/`) which is not allowed in CORS origins.

## âœ… IMMEDIATE FIX:

### Step 1: Update Environment Variable in Render
Go to your Render dashboard and update the `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable:

**WRONG (with trailing slash):**
```
FRONTEND_URL=https://nasafinalll-k8rhh8xrg-roshith-roberts-projects.vercel.app/
```

**CORRECT (no trailing slash):**
```
FRONTEND_URL=https://nasafinalll-k8rhh8xrg-roshith-roberts-projects.vercel.app
```

### Step 2: Commit Code Fix
The Django settings have been updated to automatically strip trailing slashes. You need to push this fix:

```bash
git add backend/backend/settings.py
git commit -m "Fix CORS error: Strip trailing slash from FRONTEND_URL"
git push myrepo main
```

### Step 3: Redeploy
After pushing the code and updating the environment variable, trigger a new deployment in Render.

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed in Code:

Added automatic trailing slash removal in `backend/backend/settings.py`:
```python
# Clean FRONTEND_URL by removing trailing slash if present
FRONTEND_URL = FRONTEND_URL.rstrip('/')
```

## âœ… Expected Result:
After this fix, your deployment should succeed and you'll see:
- âœ… Build successful
- âœ… Django server starts without CORS errors
- âœ… API endpoints accessible
- âœ… Frontend can communicate with backend

## ðŸ§ª Test After Fix:
```bash
# Test API health
curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/health/

# Should return: {"status": "healthy"}
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps:
1. Apply the environment variable fix in Render
2. Push the code fix 
3. Wait for successful deployment
4. Test your application

This is a common deployment issue when copying URLs from browsers that automatically add trailing slashes!
