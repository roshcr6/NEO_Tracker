# üîß SECURITY FIXES APPLIED

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed For You

### 1. Created Environment File
- ‚úÖ Created `backend/.env` file
- ‚úÖ Moved sensitive keys out of code
- ‚úÖ Verified `.env` is in `.gitignore`

### 2. Generated New SECRET_KEY
- ‚úÖ Old key: `django-insecure-asteroid-impact-simulator-2025-hackathon-key`
- ‚úÖ New key: `uh+8ajrc*lhn*q))pq*swajgl(5!bz3ekzc2^gx5zbljx)9e4#`
- ‚úÖ Updated in `.env` file

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

### CRITICAL - If Your Repo is Public on GitHub:

**The old SECRET_KEY is compromised because it was in your code!**

1. **Check if your repo is public:**
   ```bash
   # Go to: https://github.com/sanjayvarghese1/NASAfinal
   # If others can see it, the key is compromised
   ```

2. **If public, you should:**
   - Generate another new key (I gave you one, but it's visible in chat)
   - Consider the repo compromised
   - Never push sensitive keys to GitHub again

### Before Production Deployment:

1. **Set DEBUG=False** in `.env`:
   ```bash
   DEBUG=False
   ```

2. **Update ALLOWED_HOSTS** in `.env`:
   ```bash
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-domain.com,www.your-domain.com
   ```

3. **Fix CORS** - Edit `backend/settings.py` line 136:
   ```python
   CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = False  # Change from True
   ```

## üìä Security Status

### FIXED ‚úÖ
- [x] Environment variables properly configured
- [x] New SECRET_KEY generated
- [x] .env file created and protected by .gitignore

### STILL NEEDS ATTENTION ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [ ] 9 npm vulnerabilities (6 high, 3 moderate)
- [ ] CORS too permissive (allows all origins)
- [ ] Django 4.2.25 (could upgrade to 4.2.latest)
- [ ] No rate limiting on API

### ACCEPTABLE FOR NOW ‚úÖ
- SQLite database (fine for development)
- HTTP localhost (fine for development)
- DEBUG=True (fine for development)

## üéØ Quick Summary

**For Local Development:** ‚úÖ You're good to continue!

**Before Sharing/Deploying:**
1. Never commit `.env` file (already protected ‚úì)
2. Set DEBUG=False
3. Fix CORS settings
4. Consider fixing npm vulnerabilities
5. Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

1. ‚úÖ `backend/.env` - Your environment variables (DO NOT COMMIT)
2. ‚úÖ `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Full security analysis
3. ‚úÖ `SECURITY_FIXES_APPLIED.md` - This file

## üîê Your Current Keys

**SECRET_KEY:** (in `.env` file - keep secret!)
**NASA_API_KEY:** `8Bzer5xzem5a4ZGqHrw4d9oR2KGdZ8f8gJeqscQC`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember:** The NASA API key is a demo key and may have rate limits. Get your own from: https://api.nasa.gov/

## üöÄ You're Ready to Continue Development!

Your application is secure for local development. Just remember:
- Don't commit `.env` file
- Fix the issues before deploying to production
- Review the full security audit report when you're ready to deploy
